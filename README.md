# M5-Challenge-Eyasu-Debasu

This project involves the creation of a back end application that manages game store data. The API-based database application will manage inventory such as games, console and T-shirts and provide a mechanism by which users can purchase the products.

Goals
Your application should include the following components:

A simple back-end REST inventory management web service for a video game store, developed using agile techniques in a group setting. You are responsible for designing and documenting the REST API and implementing the controllers, service, layering, repository, Java data objects, and unit tests for the application based on the provided database structure.

A simple user interface that exercises your REST API functionality.
